			Gaelic Football:</b>
		<br></br>
			Gaelic football, commonly referred to as football or Gaelic, is an Irish team sport. It is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. 
			The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's goals, which counts as 3 points, or between two upright posts above 
			the goals and over a crossbar 2.5 metres above the ground, which counts as 1 point.
		<br></br>
			I have great interest in this sport as I have played it since I was 11 years old. It is a great way to keep fit and to make new friends and I would highly
			recommend it to any person. The sport is also played in other countires where there may be lots of Irish living.

		<b>Dancing:</b>
		<br></br>
			Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. Some may not consider it a sport but I would as it is 
			a way to keep fit while also having fun. 
		<br></br>
			I have been dancing since I was 3 years old and it has become a big passion of mine. It has become an escape route for me as when I am dancing, I don't think about
			anything else and any worries I have seem to fade away for a small amount of time. Dancing is very important to me for this reason, but also as my Nan was a dancer 
			in her time and she loves to live through me and my dancing career now.

		<h2><center>Travel</center></h2>
		<!-- Using the paragraph block level element to add text to the website -->
		<p>	To travel means; to make a journey, typically of some length. Travel is  big interest of mine and has been my whole life. My first time on a plane, not that I
			remember, was when I was 9 months old and my mom took me to visit my uncle in Boston.
		<br></br>
			Every year growing up we would go on family holidays and as my parents love to travel we got to experience and visit very cool places, one being South Africa. I remember
			this trip so well as it was genuinely one of the most amazing experinces ever. We got the opportunity to so a safari in the South African bush which was crazy. Of course
			we saw this big 5 along with many other amazing animals.
		<br></br>
			I believe travel is good for the soul as you can escape reality for a bit and be in your own space while experiencing different cultures and avenues. One on my goals in
			life is to travel the world and see as many places as I possibly can. Even though I have been lucky enough to see a lot of it, there's a whole lot more to see.
